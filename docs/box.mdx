# Box

This is a low-level primitive intended to be extended by other components. All `Box` components will attempt to harden the selector specificity of the styles by including the tag name, id and generated class name. The format of the generated selector will look like the following:

```css
[tag]#[generated-id].[generated-class] {
  /* All styles */
}
```

`tag` is the html element being rendered. `generated-id` is pretty self explanatory (this happens every render). `generated-class` is the class name used by `emotion` after all styles have been processed and compiled.

<PropsTable of={Box} />

We'll attempt to break the styles set on this by setting some outer rules

```css
div.some-random-div {
  background: black !important;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

<Playground>
  <style
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      __html: `
    div.some-random-div {
      background: black !important;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
  `,
    }}
  />
  An example to showcase outer styles not bleeding through
  <Box
    id="my-id"
    important
    className="some-random-div bg-yellow-lighter p-4 text-sm text-yellow-darkest border border-yellow-dark mt-4 p-64 rounded"
    tag="div"
