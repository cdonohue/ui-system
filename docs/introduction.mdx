# Introduction

UI System is a set of primitive components and utilities for prototyping/building React applications. The goal is to provide a base level of reset styles for each component, along with class utilities that are provided without any additional css rules.

## Principles

The core of UI System is powered by the `<Box />` component. It applies some basic style resets and renders an html element or component passed in using `is`. The idea is to create more complex components by composing these `Box` components together and have one unified styling system that everything adheres to.

## Getting Started

`Box` renders a `<div>` tag by default, but you can pass any HTML tag, or even another React component with the `is` prop.

Let's start using a `Box` to render a `p` tag.
Nothing too special. Try adding some utility classes to it, like `bg-grey-200`, `p-4`, or `font-serif`, or all three!

<Playground>
  <Box is="p" className="">

    dreamcatcher authentic seitan coloring book ugh hoodie. Drinking vinegar
    flexitarian waistcoat viral vaporware organic gastropub. Plaid deep v vinyl

  </Box>

We'll get into the different utility classes in a bit. For now, just know that these extra utility classes are detected by UI System and the appropriate style rules are processed with `emotion` and injected into the DOM at render time.

So, by utilizing `<Box />`, we can have a base reset along with any number of utility rules and only ship the styles that we need.

By default, UI System uses class composition to combine styling rules.

In the event that you need more specificity, just add an `id` to your component. Instead of composing classes, all styles to be applied will be wrapped into a specific css rule that uses the element's `id` and `emotion` generated class name.
For extreme circumstances, use the `important` prop. This appends `!important` to every style rule (use when you want to ensure no other outside rules cascades).

Take a look at `Box` components. Inspect them in the dev tools to see the differences in how their styles are applied.

<Playground>
  <Box className="flex">
    <Box className="w-24 h-24 bg-blue-400 rounded mr-4" />
    <Box id="special-box" className="w-24 h-24 bg-blue-400 rounded mr-4" />
    <Box
      id="important-special-box"
      important
      className="w-24 h-24 bg-red-400 rounded mr-4"
    />
  </Box>
</Playground>
