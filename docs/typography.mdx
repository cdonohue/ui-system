# Typography

<SectionHeading>Font Family</SectionHeading>

You can use the `font-sans`, `font-serif`, and `font-mono` class names to take advantage of the default font stacks provided.

<ConfigConsumer>
  {({ config }) => (
    <Box
      style={{
        display: "grid",
        marginBottom: "1rem",
        gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))",
        gridGap: "1rem",
      }}
    >
      {Object.keys(config.fonts).map((fontType) => (
        <Container className="rounded shadow overflow-hidden flex-grow mr-4">
          <Heading className="px-4 py-1 capitalize bg-grey-200 text-lg" is="h4">
            {fontType}
          </Heading>
          <List className="list-reset flex flex-wrap p-4">
            {config.fonts[fontType].map((typeface) => (
              <ListItem className="px-2 py mr-2 mb-2 text-sm rounded font-mono bg-grey-200">
                {typeface}
              </ListItem>
            ))}
          </List>
        </Container>
      ))}
    </Box>
  )}
</ConfigConsumer>

Try changing out the example below from `font-sans` to another variant.

<Playground>
  <Box className="font-sans rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 text-yellow-700 bg-yellow-100">
    <Heading is="h2">Sans</Heading>

    <Paragraph>
      What looked like a small patch of purple grass, above five feet square, was
      moving across the sand in their direction. When it came near enough he
      perceived that it was not grass; there were no blades, but only purple
      roots. The roots were revolving, for each small plant in the whole patch,
      like the spokes of a rimless wheel.
