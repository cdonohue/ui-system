# Box

Intended to be used within other components. All `Box` components will get a `<link>` inserted to `<head>` by `emotion` that will attempt to harden the selector specificity of the styles. The format of the generated selector will look like the following:

```
[tag]#[generated-id].[generated-class] {
  /* All styles */
}
```
`tag` is the html element being rendered. `generated-id` is pretty self explanatory (this happens every render). `generated-class` is the class name used by `emotion` after all styles have been processed and compiled.

<PropsTable of={Box} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: `
    div {
      background: black;
    }
  `}} />
